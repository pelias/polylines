<summary>What is Pelias?</summary>
<br />
Pelias is a search engine for places worldwide, powered by open data. It turns addresses and place names into geographic coordinates, and turns geographic coordinates into places and addresses. With Pelias, you’re able to turn your users’ place searches into actionable geodata and transform your geodata into real places.
<br /><br />
We think open data, open source, and open strategy win over proprietary solutions at any part of the stack and we want to ensure the services we offer are in line with that vision. We believe that an open geocoder improves over the long-term only if the community can incorporate truly representative local knowledge.

# Pelias Polyline Importer

The polyline importer facilitates importing road network data in to Pelias from a list of [polyline encoded](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm) line strings.

## Prerequisites

Node.js is required. See [Pelias software requirements](https://github.com/pelias/documentation/blob/master/requirements.md) for supported versions.

## Clone and Install dependencies

Since this module is just one part of our geocoder, we'd recommend starting with our [Dockerfiles](https://github.com/pelias/dockerfiles/) for quick setup, or our [full installation docs](https://github.com/pelias/pelias-doc/blob/master/installing.md) to use this module.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pelias/polylines.git && cd polylines
$ npm install
```

## Download data

Pre-processed planet-wide road network files are available to download from [Geocode Earth](https://geocode.earth/data#openstreetmap).

> Note: the file extensions `.0sv` and `.polylines` are used interchangeably, they both refer to the same file format; however there is code that looks for the `.0sv` extension which is therefore preferable.

For more information on how the extract was generated, see the wiki article: [Generating polylines from Valhalla](https://github.com/pelias/polylines/wiki/Generating-polylines-from-Valhalla).

We also have some smaller extracts for testing purposes, a small number were manually cut from pbf for the geographies of our major contributors. See the 'Generating a custom polylines extract from a PBF extract' section below for more info on how you can generate your own extracts:

**note:** these extracts were generated using a different method from the planet cut above.

- [Berlin](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pelias-data.nextzen.org/polylines/berlin.gz) (1.9MB, 49k roads)
- [New York](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pelias-data.nextzen.org/polylines/new_york.gz) (4.2MB, 102k roads)
- [Finland](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pelias-data.nextzen.org/polylines/finland.gz) (7.7MB, 100k roads)
- [Sweden](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pelias-data.nextzen.org/polylines/sweden.gz) (5.9MB, 126k roads)
- [London](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pelias-data.nextzen.org/polylines/london.gz) (5.6MB, 166k roads)
- [Paris](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pelias-data.nextzen.org/polylines/paris.gz) (2.9MB, 81k roads)
- [San Francisco](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pelias-data.nextzen.org/polylines/san_francisco.gz) (1.3MB, 27k roads)
- [New Zealand](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pelias-data.nextzen.org/polylines/new_zealand.gz) (3.1MB, 52k roads)
- [Chicago](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pelias-data.nextzen.org/polylines/chicago.gz) (3.5MB, 88k roads)
- [Singapore](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pelias-data.nextzen.org/polylines/singapore.gz) (0.6MB, 16k roads)

Once you have downloaded and extracted the data you will need to follow the *Configuration* steps below in order to tell Pelias where they can be found.

If you would like to use a different source of polyline data you might need to tweak the defaults in `./stream/pipeline.js`, open an issue if you get stuck.

## Generating your own data

You can generate a polylines file from your own data, the data MUST be encoded in the following format:

- each row of the file represents one document, rows are terminated with a newline (`\n`) character.
- rows contain multiple columns, columns are delimited with a null byte (`\0`) character.

The geometry is encoded using the [Google polyline algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm) at a precision of `6`.

NOTE: many libraries will default the precision to `5`, this will cause errors, be sure to select the correct [polyline precision](https://www.mapzen.com/blog/polyline-precision/).

There is a script included in this repo which is capable of re-encoding files generated with precison `5` to precision `6`, you can find it in `bin/reencode.js`.

Each row begins with the encoded polyline, followed by a null byte (`\0`) then followed by one or more names (delimited with a null byte) and finally terminated with a newline (`\n`).

Example:

```
{polyline6}\0{name}\0{name}\n
```

```
oozdnAwvbsBoA?g@{@SoAf@{@nAg@Plaça de la Creu
```

```
00000000: 6f6f 7a64 6e41 7776 6273 426f 413f 6740  oozdnAwvbsBoA?g@
00000010: 7b40 536f 4166 407b 406e 4167 4000 506c  {@SoAf@{@nAg@.Pl
00000020: 61c3 a761 2064 6520 6c61 2043 7265 750a  a..a de la Creu.
```

## Configuration

In order to tell the importer the location of your downloads and environmental settings you will first need to create a `~/pelias.json` file.

See [the config](https://github.com/pelias/config) documentation for details on the structure of this file. Your relevant config info for the polyline module might look something like this:

**note:** the importer currently only supports a single entry in the `files` array. Also, the config file **only** accepts "polyline" (without the "s").

```javascript
  "imports": {
    "polyline": {
      "datapath": "/data",
      "files": [ "road_network.0sv" ]
    }
  }
```

### Administrative Hierarchy Lookup

Polyline data doesn't have a full administrative hierarchy (ie, country, state,
county, etc. names), but it can be calculated using data from [Who's on
First](https://whosonfirst.org). See the [readme](https://github.com/pelias/wof-admin-lookup/blob/master/README.md)
for [pelias/wof-admin-lookup](https://github.com/pelias/wof-admin-lookup) for more information.  By default,
adminLookup is enabled.  To disable, set `imports.adminLookup.enabled` to `false` in Pelias config.

**Note:** Admin lookup requires loading around 5GB of data into memory.

## Running an import

This will start the import process, it will take around 30 seconds to prime it's in-memory data and then you should see regular debugging output in the terminal.

```bash
$ PELIAS_CONFIG=<path_to_config_json> npm start
```

## CLI tool

You can use the CLI tool to run imports and for debugging purposes:

**note:** by default the cli tool will read from `stdin` and write to `stdout`.

```bash
$ node ./bin/cli.js --help
Usage: cli.js [options]
Options:

  --file           read from file instead of stdin
  --config         read filename from pelias config (overrides --file)
  --pretty         indent output (stdout only)
  --db             save to elasticsearch instead of printing to stdout

```

### Examples

Run a 'dry-run' of the import process:

```bash
node ./bin/cli.js --config --pretty
```

Import a specific file to elasticsearch:

```bash
node ./bin/cli.js --file=/tmp/myfile.polylines --db
```

### Generating a custom polylines extract from a PBF extract

You can generate a custom polylines extract using this [OSM PBF tool](https://github.com/missinglink/pbf).

Note: golang 1.9+ is required, please ensure this is correctly installed before continuing.

```
$ go version
go version go1.10 linux/amd64

$ go install github.com/missinglink/pbf@latest

$ pbf --help

$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.nextzen.org/chicago_illinois.osm.pbf

## Issues

If you have any issues getting set up or the documentation is missing something, please open an issue here: https://github.com/pelias/polylines/issues

## Contributing

Please fork and pull request against upstream master on a feature branch.

Pretty please; provide unit tests and script fixtures in the `test` directory.

## Code Linting

A `.jshintrc` file is provided which contains a linting config, usually your text editor will understand this config and give you inline hints on code style and readability.

These settings are strictly enforced when you do a `git commit`, you can execute `git commit` at any time to run the linter against your code.

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
$ npm test
```

### Continuous Integration

Travis tests every change against our supported Node.js versions.
